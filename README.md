Included in this package:

1. R code to generate analyses and figures in the piece  - analysis_HT_20180131.R
2. The dataset - PRS_ADR_0914_v2.csv

Please note that the file path needs to be changed in the code to match with the location of the dataset on your computer.

Apart from last 3 columns, all data are provided by PRS Legislative Research. The last 3 columns of the dataset are provided from candidate affidavits by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR). I thank Milan Vaishnav for providing me with a web-scraped version of the ADR data.

The variable titles should be self-explanatory.
